This is Team 19s solution to the CDIO 2 assignment.

This is a game played by 2 players, playing with dice jump from space to space gaining or losing points as they go. Once a player gets 3000 points, they win.

It is possible to change the language between danish and english, and it is possible to change the dice size... maybe...

More updates as they come.
